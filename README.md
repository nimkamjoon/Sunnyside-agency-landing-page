# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

This is a solution to the [https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef/hub/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-_wj422nCc). Frontend Mentor - Challenges to help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

This is a frontend project in which I had to build the landing page for a design agency. I had a hard time trying to make this layout responsive, and haven't been able to do that just yet. As of now, it only works as expected on 375x812 and 1440x900. I'm going back to the drawing board, and I hope to return to this code at a later date with some more baggage so that I can refactor everything and provide a better solution.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
